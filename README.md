# ASL ComputerVision App
An iOS app built using the CoreML framework and a CNN model developed with CreateML. The app classifies images of letters in the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet.

## Overview
American Sign Language (ASL) is used by x people. I used Apple's [CreateML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml) and data from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) to train a Convolutional Neural Network
The app is intended as a proof-of-concept for using computer vision to interpret sign language.
